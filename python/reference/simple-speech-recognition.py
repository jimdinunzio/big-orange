"""Sample code for using the Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 via COM in Python.
    Requires that the SDK be installed (it's a free download from
            http://www.microsoft.com/speech
    and that MakePy has been used on it (in PythonWin,
    select Tools | COM MakePy Utility | Microsoft Speech Object Library 5.1).

    After running this, then saying "One", "Two", "Three" or "Four" should
    display "You said One" etc on the console. The recognition can be a bit
    shaky at first until you've trained it (via the Speech entry in the Windows
    Control Panel."""
